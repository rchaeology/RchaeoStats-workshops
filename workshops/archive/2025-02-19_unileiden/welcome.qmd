## Why R?

Because it's the best!

## Why R?

R is a **free and open source** software environment for statistical computing and graphics

There are 20000+ available packages on CRAN

The R community is pretty cool

## Why R(chaeology)? {background-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rchaeology/RchaeoStats/refs/heads/main/images/arch-languages.png" background-position="90% 50%" background-size="20%"}

Seems to be the most popular

## Why RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) specifically for R

It provides a bunch of extra features to make using R a delight!


## tidyverse

The tidyverse is a collection of R packages sharing the same data science philosophy

It provides a nice workflow for cleaning, visualising, and transforming data

**Aspects of 'base R' will also be covered**

## About the materials {.smaller}

It **is not** enough to cover all important topics.

It **is** enough to teach you how to find answers and implement them yourself.

## Assignment 1: Case study {.smaller}

Assignment 1 consists of finding, importing, cleaning, and exploring/analysing
a dataset.

### 1.1 Find, import, clean

Find a dataset that you want to work with, then use a script to download
and clean the data.

If you can't find a dataset, you can use the full, unmodified version of the
workshop data here: <https://osf.io/zem9p>

### 1.2 Exploratory data analysis

If the EDA module is included in the workshop, then assignment 1 is extended
to include EDA. Plot the distribution of at least two types of variables
that you are interested in exploring further.

Create at least one plot with the relationship between two variables, and
a summary table with the mean and standard deviation within groupings
of a variable. <!-- need alternative for cat variables -->

### 1.3 Data modelling

If the data modelling module is taught in the workshop, select at least two
statistical models to apply to the data.

### 1.4 Communicating results

Use Quarto to communicate the results from the previous sections of assignment 1.
This can be in the form of a report, short manuscript, presentation, or whatever format in Quarto you prefer.


## Assignment 2: Reproduce someone else's code

You will be paired up with another person in the workshop. Send each other your project and try to run the other's code.

Make a note of any issues you encounter, and provide feedback in a document.

Incorporate feedback.
